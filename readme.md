The plan so far:


this is the list of the things that i need to do
1. use the 'hero' api to get quotes from
2. use a random background from the pexels app 
   my thinking is that i can aslo use google maps api(for images) to make it look even more cooler
3. if possible, do web scraping to upload the images to instagram
4. Save the image formed in the image format, so as to use them later or to use it in '3'.
5. get some free hosting/ server 
6. use it personally

for resources, use momentum

you can also use this : 
https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/65794e/generate-screenshot-using-html-and-javascript/
to take screenshots.
i think that it might as well save the image  in your gallery.


to post the image in insta, the ways i currently have are;
1. use instagram itslef to do the work for me, 
2. use a py script to do some web scraping and automation
    2.1 on typing a certain command/ whenever i want to post,
    2.2 this script will start the website
    2.3 download the screenshot 
    2.4 save it internally
    2.5 open instagram
    2.6 go to inspect 
    2.7 go to phone mode.you can also pre-enable it(ctrl + i or f12)
    2.8 use the plus sign to upload, 
    2.9 upload the latest image in the downloaded content which will be in a folder.
    2.10 permanently delete the image form the local machine so as to save some space.
3. the last way i currently know is to use third party apps like later to schedule posts 
   but it has some limitations too as you can only schedlue 1 post per day.
4. i can also use the facebook creator studio to do the task in the first day of the month 
   and it will do the rest of the work itself.(i guess.)
5. take a look at the following methods in Y.T search : https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=api+to+post+images+on+instagram&page=&utm_source=opensearch
* search if there is some api using which you can display and post images in insta.


p.s. don't forget to use the git commands to do the flow and other git things.(i am still learning github ;-))
